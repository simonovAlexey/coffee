1) Download and install the MySQL database (e.g., MySQL Community Server 5.7.x),
   which can be found here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
   Alternatively, you may use the official MySQL docker image. Refer to the
   README.md for the Docker command line.


2) Create database and user by executing the "db/mysql/coffee.sql"
and "db/mysql/populateDB.sql" scripts. Or uncomment strings
#spring.datasource.schema=classpath*:db/mysql/coffee.sql
#spring.datasource.data=classpath*:db/mysql/populateDB.sql
 in application-mysql.properties file at the first time you run the app.
